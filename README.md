## üìñ How to use

Use the `SET #` buttons to save the position and `GO #` to jump.

### 1. Setting an Anchor (SET)

**To save an Anchor Mark on the page, select the desired text and press 'SET \# 1'.** (You can save up to 5 unique Anchors.)

* After pressing `SET # 1`, you will see a message about successful saving.
* **To reassign a tag** (overwrite), simply highlight the new text and press `SET # 1` again.

### 2. Jump to Tag (GO)

**After successfully setting Anchor \#1, scroll up or down the page and click the 'GO \# 1' button. The extension will perform an instant jump to the saved mark.**

### 3. Clear Tags (RESET ALL)

**When the marks are no longer needed, simply click the 'RESET ALL' button to erase all 5 saved anchors simultaneously.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Anchor Limit:** The system currently saves only the first **60 characters** of the selected text for the anchor name.
2. **Important Note on Jumping:** If the page contains multiple instances of the exact same saved text, the extension will jump to any one of the identical text occurrences.
3. **Security Notice:** If the anchor fails to save, it means the current webpage is protected from browser extensions (e.g., store pages, internal browser settings) for security reasons.
